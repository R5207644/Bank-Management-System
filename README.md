This is a Bank Management System built with Java Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages), designed to manage banking operations for different user roles. The system uses a MySQL database for data persistence and is intended to be run on a web server like Apache Tomcat.

## Features

The application provides functionalities for three types of users:

  * **User:** A regular customer with a bank account.
  * **Manager:** An administrator who manages user and cashier accounts.
  * **Cashier:** A teller who handles deposits and withdrawals.

### User Features

  * [cite\_start]**Account Dashboard**: Users can view their account balance, recent notices from the bank, and links to other banking services[cite: 45, 48, 127].
  * [cite\_start]**Account Statements**: View a detailed history of all transactions, including withdrawals, deposits, and fund transfers[cite: 22, 24].
  * [cite\_start]**Fund Transfer**: Transfer money to another bank account by entering the recipient's account number and the amount to be transferred[cite: 167, 174].
  * [cite\_start]**Notifications**: Check notices and updates sent by the bank manager[cite: 157, 158].

### Manager Features

  * [cite\_start]**Dashboard**: The main page for managers lists all user accounts[cite: 95, 99].
  * [cite\_start]**User Account Management**: View, send notices to, or delete any user account[cite: 104].
  * [cite\_start]**Teller Account Management**: Add or delete cashier accounts[cite: 61, 67].
  * **Customer Registration**: Register new user accounts with a minimum starting balance of Rs. [cite\_start]500[cite: 15, 17].

## Technologies Used

  * **Backend**: Java, Servlets, JSP
  * **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Font Awesome
  * **Database**: MySQL
  * **IDE**: Apache NetBeans

## Database Setup

1.  Create a MySQL database named `bank`.
2.  The application will automatically create the necessary tables (`users`, `accounts`, `teller`, `transactions`, `transfer`, `notice`) upon the first run if they don't exist.
3.  The database connection is configured in `UserDao.java`:
    ```java
    con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bank", "root", "");
    ```
    You may need to change the username and password in this line to match your MySQL configuration.

## How to Run

1.  Open the project in Apache NetBeans.
2.  Ensure you have a MySQL server running and have created the `bank` database.
3.  Right-click the project and select **Run**.
4.  The application will deploy to the configured web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat), and you can access it through your web browser.
